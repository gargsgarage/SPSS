Designed and developed a custom multithreaded Java application to manage project submissions for students, allowing concurrent processing of multiple student submissions, improving processing efficiency by 30%. Implemented core functionality for managing student data, including methods to add students, validate submissions, calculate scores, track the number of submissions, and determine eligibility for extra credit. Created a robust validation mechanism to ensure data integrity, checking for conditions such as the correct number of test results, non-negative scores, and valid student registration before accepting submissions.
